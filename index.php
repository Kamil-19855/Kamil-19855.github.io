                House Moonheart is a noble Gilnean house rooted in the traditions and pride of Gilneas. Its core is
                formed by Gilneans and Worgen, though members of other races are welcome—each individual is assessed
                personally by the Lord of the House. Those who join can expect to be primarily stationed in Gilneas, as
                this is where the House’s operations and influence are centered.
            </div>
            <div>
                We focus on a wide range of roleplay styles, including social/daily life RP, action/combat RP, and
                political intrigue RP. Whether you're a seasoned roleplayer, returning after a break, or just starting
                your journey, House Moonheart offers a supportive and welcoming environment. We’re more than happy to
                guide and assist those who are new or still finding their place.

                As a guild, House Moonheart emphasizes positive and constructive roleplay. While we welcome complex
                characters, we do not generally align with criminal or chaotic themes. Characters who thrive on
                disorder, embrace villainy, or practice dark magic without seeking redemption may find it difficult to
                fit in. That said, we treat every character as unique and will always take time to listen and work with
                you to find a narrative path that fits within the House.
            </div>
            <div>
                If you’re looking for a meaningful, story-driven experience in Gilneas, built on community, character
                development, and immersive roleplay, House Moonheart may be the home you’re looking for.

            <h3>IC</h3>
            <p> <span>House</span> Moonheart is a fallen noble house of Gilneas, once revered for their stewardship of
                the twilight
                forests and spiritual traditions of the old land. Known for their silver bloodline, moonlit sigil, and
                whispered talents with the arcane and the hunt, the Moonhearts were believed lost during the Worgen
                curse and the fall of Gilneas.

                But they endured.

                Now a Worgen-majority house, Moonheart has returned from exile—scarred, fragmented, but resolute. The
                survivors seek to reclaim their ancestral estate, rebuild their lost legacy, and adapt to a new world
                where nature’s fury, the curse of the beast, and arcane shadows blend into a nightly struggle for
                identity, loyalty, and survival. </p>
